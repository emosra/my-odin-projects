    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Contrary to belief, it's actually quite easy to make a red bean paste at home, and the same could be said for the bao dough. The only way we can make a fluffy, pillowy bun stuffed with sweet red bean filling better? Make it huge of course!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200g red bean paste filling</li>
        <li>300g all purpose flour</li>
        <li>40g sugar</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp sugar tolerant instant yeast</li>
        <li>150ml warm water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>a tiny pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a stand mixer, place all of the dough ingredients in and then knead for 6-8 minutes at slow speed.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough into a ball and set aside in warm place for 1 hour or until double in size.</li>
        <li>Add around 2 tablespoon of flour in the dough and continue kneading the dough for 2 minutes at low speed in a stand mixer.</li>
        <li>Then transfer out and divide the dough into 6 or 8 portions.</li>
        <li>Shape each portion to a round ball.</li>
        <li>Press it to a wrapper with thin edges and thicker center.</li>
        <li>Place around 1.5 tablespoon of red bean fillings in center.</li>
        <li>Seal completely and turn over and shape it into a dome.</li>
        <li>Place the buns on baking papers and then place in steamer.</li>
        <li>Cover the lid and rest for another 15 to 20 minutes at a room temperature around 28 degree C to 30 degree C.</li>
        <li>In cold water days, heat water in a pot for several minutes until warm but not boiling and then place the steamer on the warm water, rest for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Start the fire and steam the buns for another 20 minutes, turn off fire and stand for 5 minutes before enjoying.</li>
        <li>Re-steam the buns if they are cooled.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
